Introduction : The experiments utilized the KITTI dataset, consisting of labeled road data captured by vehicle-mounted LiDAR and cameras. Performance metrics included MaxF, PRE, and REC, with USNet demonstrating the highest accuracy (MaxF: 97.31%, PRE: 97.20%, REC: 97.42%), followed by SNE-RoadSeg, and the Co-Training Algorithm showing the lowest performance. The findings confirm USNet as the most effective algorithm for LiDAR-Camera fusion in road segmentation, providing high accuracy and computational efficiency.
